- (hzariv) added a new marker interface called IWillBeScriptable. 
  This interface is used by JsNative interfaces to indicate that implementation class of this interface 
  is a Rhino scriptable object and can be safetly casted to Scriptable interface.

- (yyao) added m_javaProxy in ScriptableObject and modified get and put methods
  This specific field is to store IJsJavaProxy if the current native object
  had been wrapped by an IJsJavaProxy. It wasn't added into normal property to
  avoid different "for-in" results.


- (yyao) added IJsJavaConvertible and IJsJavaConverter, modified Context and
NativeJavaObject to support custom data type conversion.

- (yyao) modified NativeJavaMethod to enable escaping extra args for Java
method invocation
  This modification is to simulate JavaScript behavior where extra args can be
  ignored
